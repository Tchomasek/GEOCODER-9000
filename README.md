geolocator web app

This is my little fun project. User gives two addresses, his email and chooses units, in which result should be calculated. 
After submiting, the distance between those two places and temperature difference is displayed and sent to the given email.
App uses API that allows only 100 free querys per day and one run of the app uses two of those.
App is also daployed on Heroku.
